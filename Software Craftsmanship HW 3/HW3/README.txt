Programming Assignment 3

This code can be compiled with OpenJDK 18.1. The unit tests can be run with JUnit 5.8.1.
I use IntelliJ IDEA as my IDE, so I've included my project's .iml file which specifies the modules (just JUnit) used in my IntelliJ project.
If you use IntelliJ IDEA, you can import my project with the included .iml file to set up the dependencies.
If you don't use IntelliJ IDEA, you can simply copy the source code into your preferred IDE and run the unit tests with JUnit 5.8.1.

Here's some guides on how to use JUnit 5 with some other popular IDEs:
